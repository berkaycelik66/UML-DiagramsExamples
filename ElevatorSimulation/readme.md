We Code The Insurance Company wants to build a 12-storey office building and equip it with the latest elevator technology. The company wants you to create a software simulator that models the operations of the building's elevators to see if they can meet the traffic flow needs within the building.

The building will have five elevators, each of which can go up to 12 floors of the building. Each elevator has a capacity of approximately six adult passengers. Elevators are designed to be energy efficient, so they only move when needed. Each elevator has its own door, floor indicator light and control panel. The control panel has target buttons, door open and close buttons, and an emergency signal button.

Each floor in the building has a door for each of the five elevator shafts and an arrival bell for each door. The arrival bell indicates that the elevators have arrived at a floor. A signal light on each door indicates the arrival of the elevator and the direction the elevator is moving. Each floor also has three sets of elevator call buttons.

A person calls an elevator by pressing the appropriate call button (up or down). A scheduler assigns one of five elevators to go to the floor where the search started. Upon entering the elevator, a passenger typically presses one or more destination buttons. As the elevator moves from floor to floor, an indicator light inside the elevator informs passengers about the location of the elevator. The arrival of an elevator to a floor is indicated by the lighting of the indicator lamp above the outer elevator door and the ringing of the floor bell. When an elevator stops at a floor, both sets of doors open automatically for a predetermined time, allowing passengers to enter and exit the elevator.

The simulator uses a "clock" to simulate real time lapse and timestamp and log events that occur in the simulation. A random number generator is used by the simulator to generate passengers and determine the departure and arrival floors for each passenger.
